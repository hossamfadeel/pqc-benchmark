# pqc-benchmark
This repository provides an automated framework for benchmarking open-source hardware (RTL) implementations of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. It is designed to clone, build, simulate, and analyze various PQC implementations to provide a standardized comparison of their performance and resource utilization.
